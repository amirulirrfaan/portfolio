            Hi! I'm Amirul, a software engineer who loves building digital
            experiences that live on the web. My journey in web development
            began in 2012 when I started customizing Blogger themes. What
            started as a fun project with HTML and CSS turned into a passion for
            creating websites and apps!

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Since then, I've worked at{" "}
            <span className="text-primary">a tech startup</span>,{" "}
            <span className="text-primary">a manufacturing company</span>, and{" "}
            <span className="text-primary">a software house</span>. These days,
            I focus on creating accessible and easy-to-use products for
            different clients.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            In my free time, you'll usually find me playing games, reading, or
            spending time with my wife and our cat ðŸ˜¼. I'm also open to
            freelancing, offering my skills in web development and creating
            accessible digital experiences.
